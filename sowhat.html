													<h3>Why should i know this?</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Singapore is a multi-racial country and is known for supporting four races together with relative stability. We must understand that foreigners are essential to Singapore’s survival. In the world, one will eventually work with foreigners, even if not always willingly. But nevertheless, not being xenophobic is a very important skill to be successful. Working with foreigners can be an eye-opening and enriching experience and it is essential that these values are taught from young. Maintain good habits and knowing foreigners will become very easy. Foreigners are not what you think they are. They too have their own families, values, cultures and religions. So why not take a step back, make peace and try to understand them? They would definitely be happy to learn more about our “Garden City”. Read on and understand why this needless things are happening.</p>

												  <h3>Stereotyping</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Regardless of whether they admit it, many people subject to stereotyping the foreigners in their countries. </p>
												<p>This stereotyping is usually unintentional, however it can make a big difference for the foreigners. Their stereotyping may stem from various means. </p>
												<p>One such way of stereotyping is that people take what happened in the past and use it to judge the current generation of foreigners from a certain country when the acts were committed by their ancestors. Also, gossip and rumors spread from unreliable sources can hinder the judgement of locals. </p>
												<p>More commonly, people do not know others well and end up judging people based on what they see. This is stereotyping. Take a look at some of the stereotypes against foreigners in other countries. They are subject to much discrimination and are not thought of as “human” in some cases too and will eventually result in the locals disliking or hating. It is essential that Singapore should avoid this.</p>

										<p>The British wealth firm manager made very insensitive and insulting remarks against public transport commuters was forced to leave the country and lost his job.</p>
										<p>This came after two of his Facebook posts began circulating on the Internet. In one, a picture of his five-year-old son on an MRT train was accompanied by the caption: "Daddy where is your car &amp; who are all these poor people?"</p>
									  <p>In the other post, his son is pictured in a silver Porsche with the comment: "...Normal service can resume, once I have washed the stench of public transport off me..."</p>
